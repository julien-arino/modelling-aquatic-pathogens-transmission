This project was initiated when I was renewing my NSERC Discovery grant a few years ago. My proposal on *Modelling inter-species pathogen transmission in an Arctic aquatic environment subject to climate change* was funded ([see some detail here](https://nserc-crsng.canada.ca/en/awards-database/810201)) and since then, some of my research has been on the topic.

## People involved

### Established researchers

## Context

With climate change, the range of some aquatic species is evolving. Because of this, some fish species resident in the Mackenzie River are now increasingly coming into contact with vagrant species, whose life cycles mean they could harbour pathogens aquired in other locations.

## Recent work

- Clotilde Djuikem and Julien Arino. [Transmission of multiple pathogens across species](https://julien-arino.github.io/assets/pdf/papers/2025_DjuikemArino-BMB87.pdf), *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*, 2025.
> In this paper, we investigate a general model for infection with $V$ viruses in $S$ species.

## Work in progress
